# Socials Link Tree

This is my first project in my Front-end journey! Feel free to give me a star 😄
<br>
It features a responsive link tree by using only HTML and CSS.
<br>
I was able to use Google Fonts @import statement to implement a non-default font-family.

## 🧠 Best practices

It features **variables**, **:hover**, **BEM**, **responsive function** (as media queries wasn't needed) - min(380px, 80%)

I also used Prettier to make the layout better on **VSCode** and used the command line for versioning with Git.
